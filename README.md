# Iteration 0
This is our overview where we organize the Commons Stack Core Team's efforts

With [Iteration 0](https://medium.com/commonsstack/celebrating-progress-one-year-into-the-commons-stack-journey-871d08e5f3b4) of the Commons Stack our focus is on staging the cultural and technical initialization tools required to make complex systems succeed. 

We have divided all the work into [Milestones](https://github.com/commons-stack/iteration0/milestones?direction=asc&sort=title&state=open) which we will continue to update during this period. 

**You can support our mission** first and foremost by **[donating](http://commonsstack.org/donate)**. You can also **contribute time** to the Commons Stack mission, find out more about this by [joining our community.](http://commonsstack.org/community)

Know that with these extra funds you will not only be supporting us as a core team, but a wide network of contributors, and every DAI contributed is spent transparently on the [Giveth DApp](https://beta.giveth.io/campaigns/5d110631994eac53adc8f21e).

With these funds we will accomplish the following **key goals**: 
- Launch our first Commons for the Token Engineering Community
- Finalize the Commons Simulator, a cadCAD-powered game illustrating how the Commons Stack will work
- Research and communicate on our initialization tools and planned components 
- Continue to grow the Trusted Seed, and be an anchor for the Commons movement 

You can find **more details** on this in our [Milestones](https://github.com/commons-stack/iteration0/milestones?direction=asc&sort=title&state=open)
